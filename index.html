      <p><span class="first-letter-style">A</span> simple Google search of the word “tribute” defines tribute as “an
        act, statement, or gift that is intended to
        show
        gratitude, respect, or admiration.” It goes on to give further synonyms as accolade, praise, commendation,
        acclaim,
        acclamation, salute. These words do not do justice to the man this webpage is about.

      <p><span class="first-letter-style">B</span>lessed with the love of a wonder wife and mother to his children, Sir
        James B. Iweobi has been married to Mrs. Rosaline
        Iweobi for more than 35years which is blessed with 6 sons.

      <p><span class="first-letter-style">M</span>y life journey started with my entrance into this world and my first
        impression was those of my parents, it was their
        love I felt first. My father worked long and hard so that my brothers and I might have the opportunities he
        never had, a
        symbol of his love.
      </p>

      <hr>
      <p><span class="first-letter-style">M</span>y father’s educational background would come as a surprise to many
        given his accomplishment in
        life, he has succeeded
        in 3 different business industries which require a sound technical knowledge of each industry from medicine to
        engineer,
        all on a standard 6 educational background, this is testament to his intelligence.
      </p>

      <hr>
      <p><span class="first-letter-style">S</span>ir James taught me to be a man, not just a human who has a penis, but
        a man who looks after his family, a man who can
        be trusted to lead when called upon, in my in 2nd year in university, I had a medical emergency that required a
        surgery
        to be done on me within 48hrs, a close friend in school had deposited a huge part of his school fees to have the
        hospital commence treatment on me, at the time technology wasn’t what we have today and when my father got
        there, he was
        able to refund the friend and even gave him a tip for taking care of me.

      <hr>
      <p><span class="first-letter-style">M</span>y dad’s favorite quote is “The reality of life is truth”, he has
        strived to live his life by those words, he ascended
        from a member of his community union to the president of the union, his unique style of handling issues is one
        of his
        many gifts I hope to emulate, although he is no more the president of the union, members of the union and other
        people
        still seek his opinion especially when it involves the community. The wisdom he exhumes, makes me very proud to
        have his
        blood cursing through my veins.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p><span class="first-letter-style">A</span>lso a very generous man, Sir James has given back so much to his
        community, my father once said to me “when God blesses
        you, a portion of that gift belongs to the people around you”, being a business man that he is, he used an
        example of
        money. He said, “When you’re blessed with N100, a percentage of that money belongs to your brothers and to the
        people
        around you”, he taught us at an early age to sharing and to give when we can. My father had this funny way of
        giving
        back to the church, the house in our home town is filled with things he donated during church thanks giving
        services and
        then bought back at the church’s auction and bazaar for more than twice the price he had bought them in the
        market.

      <hr>
      <p><span class="first-letter-style">R</span>ecognized by his church for his generosity and service to humanity,
        Sir James B. Iweobi was inducted into the order of
        Knighthood of Saint Mulumba (KSM) founded in Nigeria in 1953, it has 10,771 members, it is a great honor to his
        family
        to be counted as one of them.

      <hr>
      <p><span class="first-letter-style">I</span>t has been said that a son is the best assurance of immortality and it
        has also been said that a father wants to leave
        the best part of himself to someone else, his son. To be able to the son by hand when he is little; lead him out
        into
        the spring to show him the glories of God, the wonders of nature; to heart his confidences when he is older; to
        guide
        the way to go. To be able to point with pride and say, “see this boy? This is boy is my son!” this is passing on
        a part
        of himself, as one of his sons, I am happy and proud to have this responsibility on my shoulders.
